Fitness Tracker


For this assignment, we had to create a workout tracker. Given front end starter code to work with. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.


Business Context
A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

Acceptance Criteria
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.
The user should be able to:


Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.


Add new exercises to a new workout plan.


View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the stats page.


View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the stats page.
